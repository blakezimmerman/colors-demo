# Colors Demo

## About This Project

This project aims to demonstrate the viability of creating web apps using solely javascript.
Many have already accepted replacing HTML with JSX, but many are still critical of replacing CSS with
React inline styles. However, Radium fills many of the gaps that inline styling has left by wrapping
components to allow for the use of psuedo-classes and media queries. This project puts its main focus on the
capabilities of Radium and secondarily, it demonstrates how Flow can be used to provide extra
safety in writing components.
